This is a test!
Adding more text to the file to test hg
Actually I'm not testing hg, at this point 
I'm testing git and pushing to a remote 
github repo.  Seems to work.  Cool!
I don't really like the formatting so I
added some line feeds and carriage 
returns!
THE CAPSLOCK IS ON!!!

More testing...WHAT!
